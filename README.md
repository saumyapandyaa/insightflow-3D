# InsightFlow 3D (Work in Progress)

> ⚠️ **Project Status:** Actively in development.  
> The full codebase is being refined locally and will be pushed in upcoming updates.

InsightFlow 3D is an open-source AI-powered code-intelligence tool that transforms any repository into an interactive, city-themed 3D visual model. Directories appear as districts, files as buildings, and functions as animated agents—making large codebases easier to break down and understand visually.

The platform uses:
- **React, Vite, Three.js, React-Three-Fiber, Zustand** for the 3D interface  
- **AST analysis** to extract structure, behavior, and complexity  
- **MCP tools** (Git, Filesystem, Analyzer) for repo access  
- **Ollama local LLMs** for offline, privacy-preserving reasoning and explanations  

InsightFlow 3D aims to help engineers explore architecture, follow dependencies, understand behavior, and navigate unfamiliar codebases with far more clarity.
